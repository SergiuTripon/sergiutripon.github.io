    description: In my 2nd Year at University, I decided to look for a volunteering job, and discovered Interact Magazine who offered me the Writer & Photographer position. My highlights at the magazine were writing their Olympics Games 2012 article as part of the Spring Edition and joining another photographer to take the photos required for the article at the Olympic Park in East London.

During the second year of my University degree, I decided that I wanted to do some volunteering, so I started to look
for website that offered volunteering jobs and I found City Volunteering which is run by the university which I
attended, City University London. After spending some time searching through the website, I found a Photographer
Volunteer position at Interact Magazine, so I went on and applied for the opportunity. Further on, a few days after
applying I received a successful reply and I was invited to their office in Kentish Town, for the first meeting.

I was to work on the Spring 2012 issue of the magazine, and with the Olympics being held in London that summer, they
were planning to have an article focus on the Olympic Games 2012. All the other writers were busy with other articles,
so the magazine asked if anyone was interesting in writing the Olympics article, to which I replied by putting myself
forward for it. Initially, I was only going to be taking photographs for a few specific articles, but with this new
opportunity arising, I became the person in charge of one of the most important articles of the issue. I went on to
write a draft of the article, and then went back and forth with one of the editors of the magazine, until we were
both happy with the outcome. In addition to writing the article, I was also paired up with another team member to
manage the photography part, which we did by visiting the Olympic Park prior to the Olympics 2012 and took
representative photos for the article.
