During my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at City University London, I spent a year working as part of an
industrial placement for PSI2000, a leading provider of Risk Management solutions in the UK. My main role while at
PSI2000 was Support & Software Testing Apprentice, which meant I mostly communicated with the company’s clients but
I also got involved in a few exciting projects such as a Data Transfer Project for Leeds City Council and a Support
Call Improvement Project where I created a number of email based workflows which radically improved the efficiency
of creating and resolving cases and responding to the clients' requests within Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

However, while at PSI2000, I also had the opportunity to work within the Marketing Department. During my work as a
Marketing Assistant Apprentice, I conducted a full re-design of the PSI2000’s Public Website as well as created
numerous graphic design pieces and 6 animated videos for it. This project concentrates on the PSI2000 Marketing Videos
Project.

In November 2013, PSI2000 held their annual User Group Meeting, which invites the current clients of the company to a
meeting where they can find out about specific new feature and products as well as express and discuss issues experience
by them and how they could be dealt with. A lot of work and preparation goes into the User Group Meeting each year. One
of the tasks that the Managing Director of the company lined up was a video showcasing the company’s clients over their
17 year history. I put myself forward to create this video, which was created the day before the meeting, so slightly
under pressure. The video had an excellent response at the meeting, and the current clients of PSI2000 were amazed of
how many clients the company had over the years and that some of the clients included the likes of BBC, Royal Borough
of Greenwich, AWE, National Grid and Leeds City Council.

During the PSI2000 Public Website Project, I had a discussion with the managing director of the company and came to
the conclusion that we need more marketing material to be featured on the website, perhaps video based. We came up
with the idea of a series of video which introduce the company to the visitors which aren’t familiar with it, but it
may also provide extra information to previous visitors which they were previously unaware of. I created three videos,
titled in order, “Who We Are”, “What We Do” and “How We Do It“. The videos went on to be featured on the home page of
the public website. Following these videos we had another meeting, and decided to follow the same introduction path but
this time for the products that PSI2000 offers. I went on and created a video which focused on the introduction of the
“Asbestos Web Tracker” product and was featured on the public website’s products page. After this video, my industrial
placement at PSI2000 ended, and I started to work part-time during my final year at University, which meant time was
more limited while priorities shifted, therefore I did not contribute further to this project.

In order to get a visual representation of the project, feel free to have a look at the videos provided above and below.
