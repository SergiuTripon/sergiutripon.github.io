During the summer of 2015, I decided to create an account on [fivesquid.com](https://www.fivesquid.com/) (freelance
marketplace website where people can trade skills and services). The first service I created, was a Video Animation,
as I felt that it was the category where I had the biggest chance of achieving instant orders due to the fact that I
could post the videos that I already made on the service page, the largest portfolio in one specific category I have
to date. In the future, I do plan to create a Web Development/Design service where I will development and design website
and a Brand Identity service where I will design logos and any other marketing materials.

Fayon Cottrell from Coach Me! was the first person to contact me as she requested a video for Amazing Me! Workshop,
which is session run by her for Year 6 students who are about to take the very important leap to secondary education.
The video was to be addressed to the teachers of the Year 6 students. By using the Microsoft Word-based of what the
video should consist of provided by Fayon, I created the first draft of the video. Following further, Fayon had a few
more amendments to make to the draft video and we went back and forth until the video was exactly as she wanted it to
be. I really enjoyed being part of this project as it really showed me how amazing freelancing can be, especially
helping people and them helping you back, while they also become my contact which I may work with again in the future.
I believe that Fayon is really pleased with the outcome of the video as you can see from the testimonial and Twitter
post provided above.
